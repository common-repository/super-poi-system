The best way to integrate geographical ‘Points Of Interest’ to blogs, online travel guides etc: Set main location in a GMap and add surrounding POIs.

== Description ==
So you’re reviewing a hotel on your online travel blog - wouldn’t it be great if you could add a map, with directions to all the closest attractions? With this simple tool, we’ve made it possible!
Simply set the main relevant location for your post, add as many additional Points Of Interest as desired, and this plugin will sort out all the rest! The Super POI System will instantly create a map, providing all the information your users could possibly want. It will display the location of your POIs, the distances between the POIs and your main location, and even the corresponding travel times, both on foot and by car.

Want to add information to your POIs? Not a problem! With the Super POI System, each Point of Interest will become its own WordPress page (boosting your Search Engine Optimisation!). For each WordPress page, you can add a photo and a useful description.
One great benefit of the Super POI System is its category feature. Every time you add a new Point of Interest, you will be asked to link it to a category. Whenever you write a new post, just select the relevant categories, and only the corresponding POIs will be displayed on your map. Adding relevant information to your posts has never been so quick and easy.

A huge range of websites can benefit from this fantastic and easy-to-use plugin: from travel blogs to guides to review sites and many more. With the Super POI System, you will inevitably enhance user experience. Show users where to find a metro station, a hidden grocery store, an unmissable exhibition - anything and everything with a location - all within a matter minutes. On top of this, see your website’s SEO and ranking skyrocket, thanks to all the additional content that the Super POI System helps you generate.
